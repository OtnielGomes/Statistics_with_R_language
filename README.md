# My learning with Statistics using the R language

Descriptive Analysis Project of a Data Set
A basic descriptive analysis will be carried out on a set of data taken from the IBGE National Household Sample Survey - 2015.

We will construct histograms, calculate and evaluate measures of central tendency, separatrix measures and data dispersion.

Project dataset
National Household Sample Survey - 2015 in Brazil
The National Household Sample Survey - PNAD investigates annually, on a permanent basis, general characteristics of the population, education, work, income and housing and others, with variable frequency, according to the country's information needs, such as characteristics on migration , fertility, nuptiality, health, food security, among other topics. The survey of these statistics constitutes, over 49 years of research, an important instrument for formulating, validating and evaluating policies aimed at socioeconomic development and improving living conditions in Brazil.
